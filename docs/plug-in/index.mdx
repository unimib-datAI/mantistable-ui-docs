# Plugin

MantisTable UI is designed to be an extensible tool, as it allows users to enhance its capabilities through the use of plugins.
There are three main types of plugins that can be integrated:

1. **Export Plugins**.
2. **Add-on Plugins**.
3. **Transformation Plugins**.

To ensure security and stability, the plugins are executed in isolation within Docker containers.
This approach guarantees that each plugin operates in an independent environment, preventing interference between plugins and the core system.

:::warning
For correct execution of the plugins, remember to set the corresponding [port](/docs/getting-started/configuration#plugins).

## Plugin Types

### 1. Export Plugins

**Description:**  
Export plugins enable MantisTable UI to export data and annotations in user-defined formats.

**Use Cases:**

- Exporting tables to custom file formats (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV).
- Generating reports in PDF or other document formats.
- Custom serialisation of table data for integration with other systems.

### 2. Add-on Plugins

**Description:**  
Add-on plugins use semantic annotations to process table data, providing additional functionalities such as lexicalisation and visualisation.
These plugins enhance the interpretability and presentation of the data.

**Use Cases:**

- Visualising table data in charts or graphs.
- Generating natural language descriptions of table content.
- Integrating with external semantic services for enriched data processing.

### 3. Transformation Plugins

**Description:**  
Transformation plugins perform various transformations on table data, such as data cleaning and data transformation. These plugins help in improving data quality and reshaping data to meet specific analysis needs.

**Use Cases:**

- Cleaning and normalizing data entries.
- Transforming table structures.
- Applying complex data transformations and computations.
