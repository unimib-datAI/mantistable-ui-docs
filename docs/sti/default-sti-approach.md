This new approach, s-elBat, builds upon and enhances our previous STI approaches ([Cremaschi et. al, 2019](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2553/paper3.pdf) - [Cremaschi et. al, 2020](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2775/paper8.pdf) - [Avogadro et al., 2021](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3103/paper7.pdf)). Based on the experience gained from those solutions and their involvement in [SemTab Challenge](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/challenges/sem-tab/), it integrates a feature vector-based entity disambiguation approach. This approach combines heuristic and machine learning techniques to achieve precise disambiguation results.
